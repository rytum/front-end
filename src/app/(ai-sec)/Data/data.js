Each party (as the “Receiving Party”) will use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information of like kind (but not less than reasonable care) to: (i) not use any Confidential Information of the other party (the “Disclosing Party”) for any purpose outside the scope of these Terms; and (ii) except as otherwise authorized by the Disclosing Party in writing, limit access to Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to those of its and its Affiliates’ employees and contractors who need that access for purposes consistent with these Terms and who are bound by confidentiality obligations to the Receiving Party containing protections not materially less protective than this section. If the Receiving Party is required by law or court order to disclose Confidential Information, then the Receiving Party will, to the extent legally permitted, provide the Disclosing Party with advance written notification and cooperate in any effort to obtain confidential treatment of the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law."
